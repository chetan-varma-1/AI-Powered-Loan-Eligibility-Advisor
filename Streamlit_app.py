                This project was developed as part of my **AI Intership** at **Infosys Springboard**. The object was to build a **AI powered loan advisor system** that uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application  will be approved or rejected based on various parameters like personal and financial details of the applicant.
                This system takes the user's input and processes it through a pre-trained model to deliver a prediction about the loan status. We used alogrithms like ** Logistic regresstion** and **Random Forest** and **Decision Tress** for accurate predictions.
