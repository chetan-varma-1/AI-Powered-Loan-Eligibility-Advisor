                This project was developed as part of my **AI Intership** at **Infosys Springboard**. The object was to build a **AI powered loan advisor system** that uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application  will be approved or rejected based on various parameters like personal and financial details of the applicant.
                This system takes the user's input and processes it through a pre-trained model to deliver a prediction about the loan status. We used alogrithms like ** Logistic regresstion** and **Random Forest** and **Decision Tress** for accurate predictions.

                The **Loan perdiction System** architecture is designed to  seamlessly collect user inputs, process them through a machine learning model, and deliver accurate predictions for loan approval. Here's a breakdown of the system componets:
                
                1. **User Interface (UI): The front-end interfaces built using **Streamlit** allows users to input thei personal and financial information.
                2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data entered by users is cleaned and transformed into numerical values,ensuring compatibilit with the machine learning model.
                3. **Machine Learning Model**: The core of the system is a trained model(e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression), which predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on historical data.
                4. ** Prediction Engine**: The system runs the model on the preprocessed data and returns the loan approval decision..
                5. ** Visualization & Output**: The result is displayed to the user in a clear format with feedback on whether the loan is likely to be approved or rejected.

                Throughout my intership, I engaged in various key activities to contribute to the ** Loan Prediction System ** project:
                
                
                1. ** Data Collection** : Gathered relavant data from past loan applicants, including financial history, loan amounts, and approval outcomes.
                2. ** Data Cleaning** :  Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed categorical data to ensure compatibility with machine learning alogrithms.
                3. ** Model Selection **: Experimennted with various machine learning algorithms such as ** Logistic Regression**, ** Random Forest**, and ** Decision Tree** to find the best-preforming model.
                4. ** Model Training & Optimization** : Trained the model on historical data, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and evaluted performance metrics like ** accuracy **, ** precision ** and ** recall **.
                5. ** Deployement & Testing**: Deployed the trained model into the Streamlit application, tested the prediction system with real user inputs,  and optimized its performance.
                
                This project has provided me with hands-on experience in ** data preprocessing **  , **model training** , and ** AI deployment** , which are essential skills for my AI professional.
